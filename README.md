# L2_EX1
# Kotlin Collection Processing Assignment

This repository contains a simple Kotlin program (`Main.kt`) demonstrating the use of three fundamental collection processing functions: `filter`, `map`, and `reduce`.

## Program Objectives

The program operates on an initial list of integers (1 to 25) to perform the following operations:

1.  **Filter**: Isolates and prints all **even numbers** from the original list.
2.  **Map**: Calculates and prints the **square** of every number in the original list.
3.  **Reduce**: Calculates and prints the **sum** of all numbers in the original list.

## Files Included

* **`Main.kt`**: The Kotlin source code.
* **`output.txt`**: The complete console output of the program execution.
